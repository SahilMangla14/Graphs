/*
    To travel all the nodes of a graph which contain more than 1 connected components, we need a visited array
    We will make an visited array of size[nodes+1]
    for every node, we will check whether it is visited or not.
    If it is not visted, we will keep on traversing it
    But if it is traversed already, we move to next index in visited array
